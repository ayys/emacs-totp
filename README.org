#+title: emacs-TOTP implements Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) like specified in RFC 6238)
[[https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/emacs-totp/actions][file:https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/emacs-totp/workflows/CI/badge.svg]]
* Setup

Until released on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]:
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-totp")
  (require 'totp)
  ;; if you want the authenticator widget
  (require 'totp-widget)
#+end_src

* Usage

The command =totp-copy-pin-as-kill= interactively prompts for account
names.  Non-existing Accounts/Secrets will be added to your configured
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][Emacs auth-source]] and will be available in the =completing-read=
history in it will be used at the next invocation.

** Secret input format

=totp= supports reading secrets in =HEX= and multiple =base32= variations:

Some providers use non-standard =base32= encodings (interleaved
whitespace and missing padding characters) like:
=6BQA C4L3 O2FZ YNKR 6H7H IFFX 64GG SZZK SDEO FMV4 KVKI ASYE 65QA=

** Widget

=(totp-widget)= is self-explanatory:

The Widget-Code is just a quick hack: Pull requests are welcome!

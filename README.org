#+title: emacs-TOTP implements Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) like specified in RFC 6238)
[[https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/emacs-totp/actions][file:https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/emacs-totp/workflows/CI/badge.svg]]
* Setup

Until released on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]:
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-totp")
  (require 'totp)
  ;; if you want the authenticator widget
  (require 'totp-widget)
#+end_src

* Usage

The command =totp-copy-pin-as-kill= interactively prompts for account
names.  Non-existing Accounts/Secrets will be added to your configured
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][Emacs auth-source]] and will be available in the =completing-read=
history in it will be used at the next invocation.

** Secret input format

Only HEX-Format is supported yet.

Most OTP providers display secrets in Base32 format. Emacs doesn't
have support for base32 decoding. You have to convert from Base32 to
HEX using shell commands, for example:
#+begin_src bash
base32 -d <<<OV45GRTQARXOTU72TZLCBLUJDE2FYDSJ|xxd -g0 -p
#+end_src


** Widget

=(totp-widget)= is self-explanatory:

#+CAPTION: Emacs totp-widget

The Widget-Code is just a quick hack: Pull requests are welcome!
